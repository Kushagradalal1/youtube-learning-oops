    /*

    : Why we need oops ?
    : oops is a concept :

    : reuse the code :
    : Object oriented programming : Object & classes :
    : Object Example : Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in) : import java.util.Scanner
    : Class Concept :
    : Object--> Class--> Interface=-> package :


importance : interview point of view :
    : Four Pillars : encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance & polymorphism :

    : Object?? : real life entity : physical entity.
    : Classes?? : virtual entity : classes are called the category : logical entity.

    : we are creating the classes on the basis of an Objects.
    : we are creating a class with the help of class keyword.
    : In class we have data-members and member-functions() :
    : this process is called as encapsulation : wrapping of a data-members and members function into a single unit is called as encapsulation.


    : Pillar 1 : Encapsulation (data hiding): variables + methods : it's also used for the security purpose.
    : we can achieve the encapsulation using getter and setter method() :


    Note* new keyword is used for memory allocation : Object will hold your memory :


    : class_name object_name=new class_constructor() :

    : Non-static : every objects is having its own copy for all non-static variable : That's why every non-static variable has a instance variable.
      (because every instance is having there own copy).

    : Static : there will be a single copy for all the static variables and that copy will be shared by all the objects.
      For all the entire class having a single copy.
      Only one copy for class that's why its called as class variable.

    Note* without the main() method java program can't be run : why? : because main method is the entry point of the java program :
    Note* without static keyword also main method will not be run :

    : Access Modifier :
    Modifier        class       packages       subclasses      global
    public          yes         yes            yes             yes
    protected       yes         yes            yes             no
    Default         yes         yes            no              no
    private         yes         no             no              no

    : packages : when we are trying to make a same class name : can we do this? : answer is no we can't do this :
    : packages : we can make a same class name but it should be in a different packages if should not be in same package :

    : if we want to used the class then we need to import the package.


    : Pillar 2 : Abstraction : (Function Hiding) : background implementation details hiding.
    : Abstraction can be achieve in two ways : abstract (class) & interface (blueprint) :
    : we can achieve the abstraction 100% using the Interface :
    : When we create a class and if we declared that class as an Abstract : we can't create an Object of that class :
    : In abstact we can have final and non-final & static and non-static variables.
    :

    : Interface : Interface is a contract that defines that what a class should have.
        Interfaces are likes abstract classes
        Interfaces are used for creating the specification of a class.

    : In Interface : 1) for data-members of an interface is public by default, private and protected.
                     2) for member-functions of an interface is public and abstract : we can't make it protected and private.
                     3) we cannot create an Object for an interface : but we can create a reference for an Interface.
