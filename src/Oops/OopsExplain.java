    : Why we need oops ?
    : oops is a concept :

    : reuse the code :
    : Object oriented programming : Object & classes :
    : Object Example : Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in) : import java.util.Scanner
    : Class Concept :
    : Object--> Class--> Interface=-> package :


importance : interview point of view :
    : Four Pillars : encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance & polymorphism :

    : Object?? : real life entity : physical entity.
    : Classes?? : virtual entity : classes are called the category : logical entity.

    : we are creating the classes on the basis of an Objects.
    : we are creating a class with the help of class keyword.
    : In class we have data-members and member-functions() :
    : this process is called as encapsulation : wrapping of a data-members and members function into a single unit is called as encapsulation.


    : Pillar 1 : Encapsulation : variables + methods : it's also used for the security purpose.

    Note* new keyword is used for memory allocation : Object will hold your memory :
